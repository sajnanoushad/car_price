Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values by filling numerical columns with their mean and categorical columns with their mode.
Visualized outliers using boxplots and identified outliers using the Z-score method.
Outlier Handling:

Removed outliers based on Z-scores to clean the dataset for better model performance.
Feature Encoding:

Utilized One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for regression analysis.
Model Implementation:

Implemented various regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Performed hyperparameter tuning on the Random Forest model using Grid Search to optimize its performance.
Model Evaluation:

Compared model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
